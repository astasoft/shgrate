## Overview

shgrate is a simple database schema migration script for MySQL written in Bash.
It can be used as general purpose schema migration utility for a project. Let
say you're building an application using a framework but this framework does
not provide you the schema migration - then you can use shgrate to 'version
control' your database.

Most of the migration tools save the migrated actions into the database itself.
shgrate takes difference approach where all the migrated script is saved in
a directory so all the migrated script can be easily viewed without having
to connect to the database.

shgrate needs three directories in order to do its job. 

Directory | Use for
----------|--------
migrations | Used to store the SQL migration scripts
migrated | Used to store actions which has been migrated
rollback | Used to store the SQL rollback scripts

Keep it mind that these directories are configurable via environment variable or config file. But by default shgrate expect these directories are on the same directory as shgrate.

## Requirements

shgrate require Bash (tested with Bash 4.3.11), MySQL client binary and other shell core utilities:

* awk
* date
* diff
* grep
* logger
* sort
* tr

Those shell utilities should be available in most Linux distribution and Unix
compatible OS such as Mac OS X - even Windows using cygwin.

## Installation

Clone the project repository via github:

```
$ git clone github.com/astasoft/shgrate
```

Another altertive is download the zip tarball and extract it somewhere on your box.

## Basic Usage and Examples

Running shgrate with `-h` option will give you list of option that shgrate supports.

```
$ ./shgrate.sh
Usage: ./shgrate.sh [OPTIONS]

Where OPTIONS:
  -a NAME       use database NAME
  -b            rollback mode
  -c FILE       read the config file from the FILE
  -e ENVIRON    specify environment name by ENVIRON. Default is 'production'
  -h            print this help and exit
  -m NAME       create a migration file named NAME
  -r            dry run
  -v            print the shgrate version

Common steps when using shgrate as migration tools should covered by list below.

1. Prepare the database used for the migration
2. Create the directories for shgrate
3. Create the migration file
4. Run the migration
5. Rollback the changes

Let's walkthrough the steps above.

### 1. Prepare the database for the migration

Login to the MySQL server.

```
mysql> CREATE DATABASE mytestdb;
```

### 2. Create the directories for shgrate

On this example we will create these directories on the same directory as shgrate.

```
$ mkdir migrations migrated rollback
```

### 3. Create the migration file

When you create a migration file, shgrate automatically create the corresponded rollback file. You should edit and put your SQL statement on both files.

```
$ ./shgrate.sh -m create_table_user
Migration file: migrations/2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql.
Rollback file: rollback/2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql.
```

Below is a sample of the content of migration and rollback file we just created. You can edit it the file using your favorite text editor. On the example below I put simple statement to create table called "user".

```
$ cat migrations/2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql
-- shgrate Migration Script
-- Generated by: shgrate v1.0
-- File: 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql
-- Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2016 21:06:20 +0800
-- Write your SQL migration below this line
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) Engine=InnoDB;

$ cat rollback/2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql
-- shgrate Rollback Script
-- Generated by: shgrate v1.0
-- File: 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql
-- Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2016 21:06:20 +0800
-- Write your SQL rolllback migration below this line
DROP TABLE user;
```

### 4. Run the migration

Before running the migration it's good practice to see what shgrate would execute by running in dry run mode using `-r` option. Option `-a` tells shgrate the name of database to use.

```
$ ./shgrate -a mytestdb -r
Migrating 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql...done.
>> Contents of file migrations/2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql: 
-- shgrate Migration Script
-- Generated by: shgrate v1.0
-- File: 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql
-- Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2016 21:06:20 +0800
-- Write your SQL migration below this line
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
) Engine=InnoDB;
```

After you're sure that all the statement is correct, you can proceed the real migration.

```
$ ./shgrate -a mytestdb
Migrating 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql...done.
```

Check the database to see table "user" has been successfully created or not.

### 5. Rollback the changes

Doing the rollback is almost the same as doing the migration, you just need to use `-b` option. Let's try to rollback the changes that we've done before but let's do it in dry run mode first.

```
$ ./shgrate -a mytestdb -b -r
Rollback 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql...done.
>> Contents of file migrated/production/2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql: 
-- shgrate Rollback Script
-- Generated by: shgrate v1.0
-- File: 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql
-- Date: Tue, 05 Apr 2016 21:06:20 +0800
-- Write your SQL rolllback migration below this line
DROP TABLE user;
```

Everything seems as expected do the real rollback.

```
$ ./shgrate -a mytestdb -b
Rollback 2016_04_05_21_06_20_create_table_user.sg_migrate.sql...done.
```
